      <p>Join fellow front-end developers, themers, designers, UX
        practitioners and more for a day-long working session at
        the New Orleans Convention Center, Monday before DrupalCon.</p>

      <p>We'll discuss, debate, share, sketch and hopefully achieve consensus
      as we dive into the following topics: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Working with Twig and the D8 Theming Experience</li>
        <li>Building decoupled JS-powered front ends</li>
        <li>Evolving Drupal's component-based future</li>
        <li>Improving Drupal's admin UX</li>
        <li>Other stuff as may come up</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The front end landscape has never been so wide open. If you've ever
        wanted to help shape its front end direction, you should come to this
        event.</p>

      <h3>A working session for contributors to collaborate</h3>

      <p>This is <strong>not</strong> a training or a series of presentations.
        It is a day-long working session for people looking to evolve and
        move Front End Drupal forward. If you are looking for hands-on training,
        or looking to attend speaker talks, please consider one of the many
        Drupalcon trainings available. </p>

      <h4>Sounds great! How do I join?</h4>
