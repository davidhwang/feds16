      <p>Join fellow front end developers, themers, designers, UX
        practitioners and more for a <em>free</em> day-long working session at the
        New Orleans Convention center, Monday before Drupalcon.</p>


      <p>We'll discuss, debate, share, sketch and hopefully achieve consensus
      as we dive into the following topics: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Working with Twig and D8 Theming</li>
        <li>Building decoupled JS-powered front ends</li>
        <li>Evolving Drupal's component-based future</li>
        <li>Improving Drupal's admin UX</li>
        <li>Other stuff as may come up</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The front end landscape has never been so wide open. If you've ever
        wanted to know how Drupal is made, or wanted to help shape its
        direction, you should come to this summit.</p>
